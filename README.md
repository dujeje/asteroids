# Simplified Asteroids Arcade Game

## Project Overview
This repository contains a 2D arcade game developed as an HTML5 web page, inspired by the classic game Asteroids. The game features a canvas-based gaming area with custom-generated asteroids and player-controlled navigation.

## Game Features
- **Canvas-based Gameplay**: The game is displayed in a Canvas element that covers the entire browser window, with a visible border and optional animated starry background.
- **Dynamic Asteroid Generation**: Asteroids are randomly generated outside the visible area and gradually enter the play area with random velocities.
- **Visuals**: Asteroids are represented as rectangles. The player object is a distinctively colored rectangle placed at the canvas center.
- **Player Controls**: The player moves using keyboard arrow keys.
- **Collision Detection**: Real-time collision detection between the player and asteroids.
- **Score and Timing**: The game tracks the duration of play without collisions, with a goal to survive as long as possible.
- **High Score Memory**: The best survival time is stored using HTML5 Web Storage API.
